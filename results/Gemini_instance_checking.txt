        "reasoning_steps": "The knowledge base states that :LarryPage :manages :Google. The domain of the :manages property is :CompanyManager, so :LarryPage is a :CompanyManager. Since :CompanyManager is a subclass of :Manager and :Manager is a subclass of :Employee, :LarryPage is inferred to be an :Employee. The :worksIn property has :Employee as its domain and :Company as its range. While it is stated that every :Employee must work in something (ObjectSomeValuesFrom( :worksIn owl:Thing)), there is no axiom or sub-property relationship (e.g., SubObjectPropertyOf( :manages :worksIn)) that implies that a manager of a company also \"works in\" that same company in the technical sense of the :worksIn property. Therefore, the assertion does not hold.",

As an :Employee, he must work in some company, but the knowledge base does not provide any specific :worksIn assertion for :Matteo. The company :Unicredit is associated with the :Lawyer and :AIEngineer positions, while :Matteo is the referent for the :SoftwareEngineer position.
