## Response:
A1:
We are given the explicit assertion ObjectPropertyAssertion( :manages :LarryPage :Google).
From the ontology:


Domain( :manages ) = :CompanyManager

Range( :manages ) = :Company

FunctionalObjectProperty( :manages )


Thus, from :manages(:LarryPage, :Google) we infer that :LarryPage is a :CompanyManager.
We also have: SubClassOf( :CompanyManager :Manager ) and SubClassOf( :Manager :Employee ).
So, :LarryPage is an :Employee.


For employees, we have the restriction:
SubClassOf( :Employee ObjectSomeValuesFrom( :worksIn owl:Thing ) )
This means every employee must work in some company, but it does not specify which company.


Additionally, we already know Google is a Company. However, there is no axiom stating that managing a company implies working in that same company, and no rule connecting :manages to :worksIn.


Therefore, although LarryPage must work in some company, we cannot conclude that it is Google.


--- NO



A2:
We are given:
ClassAssertion( :Recruiter :Matteo )


From the ontology:
SubClassOf( :Recruiter :Employee )


Therefore, Matteo is an Employee.
Employees must satisfy:
ObjectSomeValuesFrom( :worksIn owl:Thing )
So Matteo must work in some company.


We check existing assertions:
ObjectPropertyAssertion( :worksIn :Francesca :Unicredit )
ObjectPropertyAssertion( :worksIn :Marco :Google )


There is no assertion stating that Matteo works in Unicredit or any other company.


The open world assumption applies: absence of evidence does not imply falsity, but since we are asked whether the specific assertion holds, and it is neither stated nor derivable, it cannot be entailed.


--- NO



A3:
We are given:
ObjectPropertyAssertion( :manages :Giulia :PosteItaliane )


From domain of :manages:
ObjectPropertyDomain( :manages :CompanyManager )


So Giulia is a CompanyManager.
We also have:
SubClassOf( :CompanyManager :Manager )
SubClassOf( :Manager :Employee )


Therefore, Giulia is an Employee.


No disjointness conflicts apply here.


--- YES



A4:
We are given explicit assertions:
ObjectPropertyAssertion( :hasReferent :AIEngineer :Marco )
ObjectPropertyAssertion( :hasReferent :SoftwareEngineer :Matteo )


The ontology states:
Domain( :hasReferent ) = :Job
Range( :hasReferent ) = :Recruiter


Thus, AIEngineer has referent Marco, and SoftwareEngineer has referent Matteo.


There is no axiom stating that a job can have only one referent (no functionality), but also no rule allowing us to infer additional referents beyond those asserted.


Since the assertion ObjectPropertyAssertion( :hasReferent :AIEngineer :Matteo ) is not stated and not derivable from any other axiom, it does not follow.


--- NO
