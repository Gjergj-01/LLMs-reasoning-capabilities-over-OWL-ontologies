    "reasoning_steps": "To determine whether the knowledge base is consistent, we must analyze its axioms and assertions to see if they lead to a contradiction.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze Class Relationships and Disjointness:**\n    The knowledge base contains several disjointness axioms, which define classes that cannot have any individuals in common. One of these axioms is:\n    `DisjointClasses(:Employee :Candidate)` (Line 42).\n    This axiom states that an individual cannot be both an `Employee` and a `Candidate` at the same time.\n\n2.  **Examine Assertions about the Individual :Luca:**\n    The knowledge base contains several assertions concerning the individual named `:Luca`:\n    *   `ClassAssertion(:Candidate :Luca)` (Line 67) explicitly asserts that `:Luca` is an instance of the `Candidate` class.\n    *   `ObjectPropertyAssertion(:applies :Luca :DataEngineer)` (Line 74) and `ObjectPropertyAssertion(:applies :Luca :CloudEngineer)` (Line 75) also imply that `:Luca` is a `Candidate` because the domain of the `:applies` property is the `Candidate` class (`ObjectPropertyDomain(:applies :Candidate)`).\n    *   `ObjectPropertyAssertion(:hires :Marco :Luca)` (Line 78) further implies that `:Luca` is a `Candidate`. This is because `:hires` is a subproperty of `:interviews` (`SubObjectPropertyOf(:hires :interviews)`), and the range of `:interviews` is the `Candidate` class (`ObjectPropertyRange(:interviews :Candidate)`).\n    *   `ClassAssertion(:Employee :Luca)` (Line 95) explicitly asserts that `:Luca` is an instance of the `Employee` class.\n\n3.  **Identify the Contradiction:**\n    Based on the assertions, `:Luca` is explicitly and/or implicitly declared as:\n    *   An instance of the class **`Candidate`**.\n    *   An instance of the class **`Employee`**.\n\n    However, the knowledge base explicitly states that `Employee` and `Candidate` are **disjoint** (`DisjointClasses(:Employee :Candidate)`). This means it is impossible for any individual, including `:Luca`, to belong to both classes.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Consistency:**\n    Because the individual `:Luca` is asserted to belong to two disjoint classes, the knowledge base contains a fundamental contradiction. In OWL DL, a knowledge base is inconsistent if there is no possible model that satisfies all its axioms and assertions. Since no model can satisfy both the disjointness axiom and the class assertions for `:Luca`, the knowledge base is inconsistent.\n\nThe individual `:Luca` being both a `Candidate` and an `Employee` violates the disjointness axiom between those two classes.",
