## Response:
Q1:


We look for individuals that satisfy Employee AND interviews VALUE Luca.

The property hires is a subproperty of interviews, so if x hires y, then x interviews y.

We have hires(Marco, Luca), therefore interviews(Marco, Luca).

The domain of interviews is Recruiter, and Recruiter ⊑ Employee, so Marco is an Employee.

No other individual is stated or inferred to interview Luca.
--- [Marco]


Q2:


All individuals explicitly asserted or inferred to be Employees:
Francesca and Matteo are asserted as Recruiters → Recruiter ⊑ Employee.

From Q1, Marco is inferred to be a Recruiter → Employee.

manages(Giulia, PosteItaliane) and manages(LarryPage, Google); domain of manages is CompanyManager, and CompanyManager ⊑ Manager ⊑ Employee → Giulia and LarryPage are Employees.

headOf(Alessio, CyberSecurityTeam); domain of headOf is TeamManager, and TeamManager ⊑ Manager ⊑ Employee → Alessio is an Employee.

composedBy(CyberSecurityTeam, Emanuela) and composedBy(CyberSecurityTeam, Fabio); range of composedBy is Employee → Emanuela and Fabio are Employees.
--- [Francesca, Matteo, Marco, Giulia, LarryPage, Alessio, Emanuela, Fabio]


Q3:


We look for Employee AND interviews VALUE Ann AND hires SOME.

interviews(Matteo, Ann) is given, so Matteo satisfies interviews VALUE Ann.

However, Matteo has no hires assertions.

Marco satisfies hires SOME (hires Luca), but there is no statement or inference that Marco interviews Ann.

No individual satisfies both conditions simultaneously.
--- [∅]


Q4:


We look for individuals that satisfy worksIn VALUE Google.

Given worksIn(Marco, Google).

No other worksIn relation with Google is stated or inferred.
--- [Marco]
