## Response:
Let us check the main implications produced by the axioms and assertions.



1. Consequences of property hierarchies and domains/ranges


SubObjectPropertyOf( :hires :interviews )
So every hires(x,y) also implies interviews(x,y).

ObjectPropertyDomain( :interviews :Recruiter )
If interviews(x,y) then x is a Recruiter.

ObjectPropertyRange( :interviews :Candidate )
If interviews(x,y) then y is a Candidate.



2. Derivations from assertions


We have:


ObjectPropertyAssertion( :hires :Marco :Luca )


By subproperty:


interviews(Marco, Luca)


Using domain and range of interviews:


Marco is a Recruiter

Luca is a Candidate


So we infer:


ClassAssertion( :Recruiter :Marco )
ClassAssertion( :Candidate :Luca )



3. Existing class assertion for Luca


The knowledge base already contains:


ClassAssertion( :Employee :Luca )


Thus Luca is both:


Candidate

Employee



4. Disjointness violation


The ontology states:


DisjointClasses( :Employee :Candidate )


So no individual can be both an Employee and a Candidate.


But Luca has been inferred to be both.



5. Conclusion


Since Luca must simultaneously belong to two disjoint classes, a contradiction arises.


Therefore, the knowledge base is inconsistent.



NO
